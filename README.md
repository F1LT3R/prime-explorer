Prime numbers from `3` - `9,999,991` are loaded into memory. These numbers can be "marked" and used to sieve (solve) larger composites (thereby revealing larger primes).

Note: I don't consider 2 to be a _True Prime_ because it can not be used sieve later primes.

Also: This code has not optimized for drawing speed. It is using DOM elements, so it's very slow.
